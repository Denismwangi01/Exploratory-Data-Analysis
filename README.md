# Tweet Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing tweet data for further analysis. The dataset contains several columns, including an ID, an Entity, a Sentiment label, and the Tweet text. Our goal is to ensure that the tweet text is clean and ready for analysis tasks such as generating a WordCloud or performing sentiment analysis.

## Data Exploration
1. **Overview:**  
   We began by exploring the dataset to understand its structure. We checked the number of rows and columns and identified missing values in the data.
   
2. **Missing Values:**  
   - The columns for ID, Entity, and Sentiment had no missing values.  
   - The Tweet column had about 0.92% missing data.  
   
   **Why It Matters:**  
   The Tweet column is crucial because it contains the text we want to analyze. Even though the missing percentage is small, itâ€™s important to handle these missing values to avoid errors in later analysis steps.

## Data Cleaning
1. **Objective:**  
   We needed to clean the tweet text by converting it to a consistent format and removing unwanted characters while keeping the important content intact.

2. **Cleaning Process:**  
   - **Convert to Lowercase:**  
     We transformed all characters to lowercase to ensure that words like "Hello" and "hello" are treated the same.
   
   - **Remove Unwanted Characters:**  
     We removed punctuation and special characters that are not letters, digits, or whitespace. This step is essential for ensuring that our analysis (like generating a WordCloud) focuses only on meaningful words.
   
   - **Fixing an Issue:**  
     Initially, our cleaning function mistakenly removed spaces, which resulted in empty cleaned tweets. By identifying this problem and adjusting the regular expression (using whitespace `\s` instead of non-whitespace `\S`), we fixed the function so that it keeps the spaces between words.
   
   - **Remove Extra Spaces:**  
     Finally, we replaced multiple spaces with a single space and trimmed any extra spaces at the beginning or end of the text. This ensures that the tweet text remains clear and readable.

## Next Steps
After cleaning the tweet data, we plan to:
- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Analyze the distribution of sentiment labels and other key aspects of the data.
- **Data Visualization:**  
  Create visualizations such as a WordCloud to highlight the most common words in the tweets.
- **Advanced Analysis:**  
  Use the cleaned data for tasks like sentiment analysis or other forms of text analysis.

## Conclusion
In this project, we learned how to explore a dataset, handle missing values, and clean tweet text effectively. By ensuring that the data is clean and consistent, we lay a solid foundation for further analysis and visualization tasks. This process is crucial for any data science project where quality data is the key to meaningful insights.
